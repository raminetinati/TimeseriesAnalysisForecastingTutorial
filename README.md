## Microsoft Machine Learning Workshop - Timeseries Analysis

The following tutorial will teach the basics of how to work with Timeseries data

The tutorial will cover a range of topics from data analysis, exploration, forecasting, predictions, and neural networks

The tutorial begins with learnignn how to load and explore a timeseries dataset, check that the columns are what we expect, and then perform a decomposition of the timeseries to explore the underlying components:
 - Observed
 - Trend
 - Seasonality
 - Residual
 
Following the exploration of data, we will then learn what it means to stationarise the data, and how to test once differencing has been applied (the method used to stationarise). 
 
Following this, we will explore how a SARIMAX model can be fitted to a simple dataset (of 140 data points), and used for forecasting purposes.

Finally the tutorial will look at alternative methods to model timeseries data, with a quick review of a Recurrent Neural Network, in the shape of a single layer LSTN.
